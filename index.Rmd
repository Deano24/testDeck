## Why this App

I built this app because obesity is body size can be directly related to health issues such as: malnutrition and obesity. There can be several reasons why a person can have a certain body size (muscle builders, high metaboloc rates and so on) but in a large amount of cases it is down to poor health choices.
Some individuals do not know that they are currently at a health risk due to their body size and I hope that this application can allow persons to quickly and efficiently calculate their BMI and use this information to make better health related choices.

## Data Interpretation

1. The system uses the calculation below to get the BMI $$(\frac{weight}{height^2})*703$$
2. For standardization in the formula the height is converted from the chosen unit to inches and weight to pounds.
3. Converting feet to inches is done by $$feet*12$$
4. Converting ounce to pounds is done by $$ounce/16$$
5. Converting ounce to pounds is done by $$stone*14$$
